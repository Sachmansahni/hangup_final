Welcome to the Chat Application! This project is a  command-line-based chat server and client system implemented in C. It allows users to establish a connection over TCP/IP and exchange text messages in real-time. The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port, handles client requests, and facilitates bidirectional communication between connected clients. This project serves as a foundational example of socket programming, showcasing essential concepts such as socket creation, binding, listening, accepting connections, and data transmission.
